  Function to compute n-parameters logistic regression.

\description{
  This function computes a weighted n-parameters logistic regression, given x and y values. See \code{Details}.
%%  ~~ A concise (1-5 lines) description of what the function does. ~~

\usage{
nplr(x, y, useLog = TRUE, LPweight = 0.25, npars = "all", method = c("res", "sdw", "gw", "Y2", "pw"))
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{x}{ a vector of numeric values, e.g. a vector of drug concentrations.
%%     ~~Describe \code{x} here~~
}
  \item{y}{ a vector of numeric values, e.g. a vector of responses, provided as proportions of control.
%%     ~~Describe \code{y} here~~
}
  \item{useLog}{ Logical. Should x-values be transformed to \eqn{log10(x)}. Default is \code{TRUE}.
%%     ~~Describe \code{useLog} here~~
}
  \item{LPweight}{a coefficient to adjust the weights. \eqn{LPweight = 0} will compute a non-weighted np-logistic regression.
%%     ~~Describe \code{LPweight} here~~
}
  \item{npars}{ a numeric value (or \code{"all"}) to specify the number of parameters to use in the model. If \code{"all"} the logistic model will be tested with 2 to 5 parameters, and the best option will be returned. See \code{Details}
%%     ~~Describe \code{npars} here~~

  \item{method}{ a character string to specify what weighted method to use. Options are \code{"res"(\code{Default}), "sdw", "gw", "Y2", "pw"}. See \code{Details}

\details{
The n-parameter logistic regression is of the form:
\deqn{
y = B + (T - B)/[1 + 10^(b*(xmid - x))]^s
}
Where \code{B} and \code{T} are the bottom and top asymptotes, respectively, \code{b} and \code{xmid} are the Hill slope and the x-coordinate at the inflexion point, respectively, and s is an asymetric coefficient.
This equation is sometimes refered to as a 5-parameter logistic regression, or the Richards equation.

When specifying \code{npars = 4}, the \code{s} parameter is forced to be \code{1}, and the corresponding model is a 4-parameter logistic regression, symetrical around its inflexion point.
when specifying \code{npars = 3 or 2}, add 2 more constraints and force \code{B} and \code{T} to be \code{0} and \code{1}, respectively.

Weighted methods:

The model parameters are optimized, simultaneously, using \code{\href{http://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/stats/html/nlm.html}{nlm}}, given a sum of squared errors function, sse(Y), to minimize:

\deqn{
  sse(Y) = \Sigma [W.(Yobs - Yfit)^2 ]
}

where Yobs, Yfit and W are the vectors of observed values, fitted values and weights, respectively.

In order to reduce the effect of possible outliers, the weights passed to sse(Y) can be computed in different ways, specified in \code{nplr}.

The residuals-weights (method \code{"res"}) computes the weights as:
\deqn{
  W = (1/residuals)^LPweight
}
where \code{residuals} and \code{LPweight} are the quadratic difference between the observed and fitted values, and a weight-adjustment coefficient, respectively. Best results are generally obtained by setting \eqn{LPweight = 0.25} (default value), while setting \eqn{LPweight = 0} results in computing a non-weighted sum of squared errors.

The standard-weights method (\code{"sdw"}) computes the weights as:
\deqn{
  W = 1/Var(Yobs_r)
}
where \code{Var(Yobs_r)} is the vector of the within-replicates variances.

The general-weights method (\code{"gw"}) computes weights as:
\deqn{
  W = 1/yfit^LPweight
}
where \code{yfit} and \code{LPweight} are the fitted values and a weight-adjustment coefficient, respectively. As for the residuals-weights method, setting \eqn{LPweight = 0} results in computing a non-weighted sum of squared errors.

\value{
An object of class \code{nplr}.

The following model parameters, performances, and values are stored as slots and can be retrieved using the \code{nplrAccessors} functions:  

- original x values, in Log10 if \code{useLog} was set to TRUE. 

- original y values.  

- y fitted values.  

- x-curve values (a sequence of 200 values from min(x) to max(x)).  

- y-curve values (200 fitted values given x-curve).  

- number of parameters: for the best model if \code{npars} was set to 'all', or specified by the user otherwise.

- logistic model parameters.  

- inflexion point coordinates.   

- goodness-of-fit.  

- standard error.

- area under the curve (AUC) estimated by both the trapezoid rule and the Simpson's rule.
